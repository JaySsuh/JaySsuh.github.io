Software engineering sparked an interest in me, due to the main aspects of problem solving, and a way to practice my quick thinking skills. Since I am interested in the security science industry, and industry that is mostly if not all problem solving skills, I felt that the best way to excel in that field was to improve my problems solving skills, what better way to practice than to learn how to problem solve, because how else would I be able to solve and fix the code that other people wrote, when I myself am unable to write the code either. So learning how to program larger scale projects efficiently, means I would know what to look for in other people’s code.

Landing a job that involves problem solving is my main goal in software engineering, the skills that I can take away in the class can also correlate to more than just in coding, with the quick thinking skills that we practice in the WODs as well as the skills necessary to solve projects will also help me wherever I go, because there will always be scenarios where you would have to think quick and on your feet in the real world, and there will always be problems and obstacles that you would have to overcome and software engineering can help me hone and define those skills that I believe that I am lacking in.

As for something that I would like to take away from this class that would be applicable to my future career, I would like to become better at learning a wide range of languages, and IDE’s that I would have to use sometime in the future. Learning to work with other people in a large, complex project is also something that I would love to take away by the end of this course, because more likely than not, you are going to be working with your peers to tackle complex large scale systems, and learning how to communicate with and work with other people will be beneficial to not only in my future occupation but also in building relationships.
