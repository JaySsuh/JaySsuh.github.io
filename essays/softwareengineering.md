### What I thought
At first I came into this class thinking, yeah a class where I just create websites and have tons or projects that I have to do. I genuinely believed that this class was a very project oriented class, I have never been more incorrect about this class, sure the main focus of the class was to create websites and develop apps, but there was more in depth about concepts such as ethics, and standards that programmers have to uphold.

### if you don't code like me you're doing it wrong!
Before this class I knew that there were some coding standards that people have to follow, such as naming conventions, you don’t want to name things randomly, keep them consistent with the theme of the project and what you are working on. Make sure to hit enter when after the “{“ in a for or if loop. You have to be insane to keep everything in a single line for a loop, but I digress. There wasn’t much I thought I needed to change how I coded, but going into more in depth about ESLint and the standards that it upholds to us, was when I realized how incorrect I’ve been coding. Obviously coding formats are unique to everyone, and you don’t have to necessarily follow ESLint to a T and use it for the rest of your life, but I found it to be good practice for eventually working for companies, to make it easy to understand for programmers and non-programmers to understand what the code actually does. But beyond just software development, you can apply coding standards to everything that you do, what may seem easy to understand to you might not be easy to understand to everyone, so you have to at least try and lower yourself so that other people can actually understand.

### I have an IDEA
Honestly, throughout all of the IDE’s that I’ve used so far, I actually feel that IntelliJ is the easiest to use, and it's the most visually appealing. To be fair the only other 2 that I’ve ever used were Eclipse and Visual studio, Eclipse was just a mess, it was ugly and it was kind of confusing, and VS code was visually appealing and it wasn’t too hard to use. But IntelliJ is just a bit better than VS in my opinion. Sure ESLint had some issues in IntelliJ like trying to find a picture when it’s literally right there in the same folder. But besides that it’s definitely an IDE that I can see myself using in the future, if I have the choice and if I could of course.

### who needs morals when you have money right?
Everyone needs ethics right? Well maybe not lawyers or real estate agents or customer service agents, but besides them I feel like most people have a sense of what's ethical and what's not. Now, there was this debate I recall of whether someone who is proficient in AI should be equal or even above someone who is proficient in coding, and the AI user is a tall white male if that matters. Should people who use AI be allowed to have the same salary as those who actually understand and write their own code? But we’re not here to debate, I mean you’re just reading an essay how would that even be possible? Anyway, with the recent development of AI there are many wondering if robots would actually take the jobs of some professions, so there is a whole side of the internet that very strongly opposes the development of advanced artificial intelligence, and another that argues if someone was actually good at something robots wouldn’t be able to replicate much less steal the jobs. But outside of something like programming, is it really profitable to keep one's ethics, do morals take precedence over that big fat paycheck? Yes it does. Or does it?
