For Software engineers, asking specific and well rounded questions will often get you a coherent answer, as having an obscure question that leaves interpretation to the reader often results in an ambiguous answer. Smart questions result in smart answers, likewise stupid questions will result in stupid answers. Generally smart questions cover all bases so nothing is left ambiguous for a higher chance of getting an answer that you actually want. For software engineers getting an ambiguous answer for your questions can and will get you even more lost, or at the very least lead you to the wrong answer, so you would always want to ask specific, accurate questions to what you’re looking for, having examples such as pictures and showing your code, where you went wrong also helps the reader understand what you’re are stuck on.

A valid example for a smart question would look something like this:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15285534/isprime-function-for-python-language
Basically this question was asking the function of a variable in the python code for loop, they showed the code, explained their issue, in this case it was more of a question as to why the code would run, even going as far as to bold the main question so the reader has an easier time understanding what exactly they were asking about. And since the question was specific, clearly stated the issue, and showed a visual example of what the problem they encountered, the question was met with a specific, well defined answer that covers most if not bases and is easy for the reader to understand. 

Similarly, a non-smart question would be a very vague prompt, and most likely a question that they could find on the front page of google, maybe even if they scrolled down even a little bit, nonsmart questions would be something that would have an obvious answer if the user put even a little bit of effort into actually researching the topic on their own instead of immediately asking a forum about solutions. Incidentally, the same applies to questions that are too vague, and don't have enough information for the reader to actually give a concise answer. For example lets use the question used in the previous paragraph, and let's say that, instead of showing the code and explaining their thought process behind it, letting us know what they already know, and what they wish to know. They simply said “why do we need to square root the n in a isPrime function”, that would obviously result in either no answer, or more likely than not, the user being shamed on the platform for asking a question in such a manner, wasting time for both the user and the readers.

So we would want to ask questions that are well thought out and detailed so that the reader can give you an answer that can hopefully help you solve the problem, and help you learn more about the topic.
