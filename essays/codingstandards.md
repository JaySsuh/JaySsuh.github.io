## Have I had experience?
Given that this is my first time using ESLint and IntelliJ, as well as my first time being conscious about coding standards, I currently believe it to be trivial for the most part, such as needing to have an extra line at the end of the code, needing a space before each bracket opening, and counting the number of spaces in the indentation at the start of a new line. I think it’s very superficial to be mindful about having an extra line at the end of my code, since it won’t change my code itself, I am personally a strong believer that as long as the code runs and gets the job done, in a timely and efficient manner, the structure and format of the program shouldn’t matter as much. However, for some parts of the coding standards I do believe it to be beneficial in the long run,such as commenting on your code, indentations in your loops to make them more coherent, which helps especially when you are working on a large project or working with other people on the same project, it helps the reader(s) understand what the code is talking about better. But, I still do strongly believe that a main focus of a programmer shouldn’t be the coding standards, I don’t think that having a space right before an opening bracket or a space before and after the use a comma shouldn’t be the reason the code doesn’t run, I think indentations matter to an extent, but not the point where someone should go out of their way to correctly reformat their entire project.

## Will it benefit me?
I don’t believe that being mindful of such things will make me a better programmer for Javascript or most other languages, however, I do believe that this is good practice for learning a language and becoming proficient in Python, where indentations and spacing plays a major role in the effectiveness of the language. But I do believe that taking coding standards in mind will improve the ability to work with other individuals on a single project, if the group has a universally accepted style, then it makes it easier for individuals to acknowledge the way the code functions.

## I have an IDEA!
Although I’ve only had a week of experience with ESLint and IntelliJ, I like the IDEA, it feels very smooth to use and appearance wise it is much more appealing than Eclipse, and much easier to use than VScode. However, ESLint is another story. I'm glad the terminal in IntelliJ tells the user what coding standard they broke and the location in the program that it’s broken, so following coding standards is very straightforward, and most of the time it's a very simple fix. It’s also nice getting familiar with the keybindings that help navigate through the console. I’m glad that IntelliJ was my first experience with proper coding standards that were strictly enforced, so the programmer HAS to follow the proper guidelines, otherwise there will be error symbols, and the program will refuse to run unless the changes have been made. Luckily, the IDEA tells you exactly what and where the problem lies, so it makes these fixes very simple and easy so getting a checkmark is tedious, but easy work. Eventually there comes a time where the standards are just engraved into your brain, and it becomes muscle memory so you don’t have to consciously try to fix up your code, and if you do ever forget to put a space or 2, the terminal will immediately let you know.
