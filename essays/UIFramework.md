## Hows UI Frameworks so far?
Yes, sure UI Frameworks isn’t an easy thing to learn how to use, and to make matters worse we have to learn how to use Bootstrap 5?! Perchance. But in my opinion I do think that it makes my life easier when coding websites, I couldn’t even begin to imagine how difficult it would be to create a navbar?! Using just CSS and HTML. Besides the obvious time that it would save in the long run, it would also save tons of space and our code (hopefully) won’t look messy and hectic. Yes, you could attain the same results by just using HTML and CSS, but that would be too easy. We want to suffer, until it becomes second nature, and then we realize how much easier and more useful it is than just brute forcing everything with HTML. 

## Hows Bootstrap?
With what I’ve experienced with Bootstrap 5 currently I do think it makes coding websites a lot easier by a mile, especially the small things like formatting, fitting, centering, and especially making that god forsaken navbar. And don’t even get me started on making text over a picture, which isn’t a tough process to do in the least, but it was difficult when you're put on the spot in a WOD. But if I were to try to all of that with only HTML I probably would've actually gone insane by now, but thanks to Bootstrap 5 I can function normally for longer! Besides saving you a lot of time and headaches, it also saves you a ton of space for all your coding desires. 

## What are the benefits
Like I've said earlier, the benefits of using Bootstrap instead of just HTML heavily outweight the cons of just not using Bootstrap, it helps you implement methods and functions for your websites a lot easier and more efficiently. You barely have to use your CSS file, because everything that you want or need to do you can do it in your HTML file instead. Not only that! but its also a lot easier to use when trying to fix up little bugs or mistakes that you may have made in your code, as it makes keeping trakc and organizing your entire project a cakewalk! Get Bootstrap 5, today.
