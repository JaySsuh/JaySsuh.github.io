I know that this isn't a techical project, but one of my fondest achievements was the time that I spent in taekwondo. During my time there, I was miserable, often trying to do anything to get out of it.
But looking back, it is one of my fondest memories as a child, and even into my years as a young adult. Teaching others was an experience that I'll never forget, to teach something means to understand and grasp the topic perfectly and fully.
And taekwondo was one of the topics that I fully mastered and fully understood, so I could better relay the information to children who aren't the greatest at understanding.
